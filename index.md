## 14BME0133:
I am better known as 14BME0133 in this realm. This  website is (but not limited to) a comprehensive compilation of the work produced and directed towards the completion of myriad, higher degree science, engineering and technology full-time undergraduate degree courses. I  aspire perfection in the domain of engineering, ushered by my blindfolded scientific temparament, & am keenly devoted to it's advancement. You can also follow a gist of my hobbies here at the Inter-Networks by logging onto http://n1x.website .
    
### Site Notes for newcomers: 
Enter "http://14BME0133.github.io/" followed by the  subject code "ZYX987" in your shell to shoot up the docs for the required course. Also, there are a lot of surprising and enticing reads flourishing in this webs partitions. However, to limit unduly access, I've temporarily disabled all meta-tags and hyperlinks, leading to a semi-private robots.txt ( NO, even thats off ya hands x'D for now atleast!)
