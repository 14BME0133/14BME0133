## 14BME0133:
I am better known as 14BME0133 in this realm. This  website is (but not limited to) a comprehensive compilation of the work produced and directed towards the completion of myriad, higher degree science, engineering and technology full-time undergraduate degree courses. I  aspire perfection in the domain of engineering, ushered by my blindfolded scientific temparament, & am keenly devoted to it's advancement. You can also follow a gist of my hobbies here at the Inter-Networks by logging onto http://n1x.website .  


### Notes for NEWCOMERS:  
Enter "http://14BME0133.github.io/" followed by the  subject code "ZYX987" in your shell to shoot up the docs for the required course. Also, there are a lot of surprising and enticing reads flourishing in this webs partitions. However, its limited -- to shunt unduly access, Things are fuuzy here.. No zer0s, neither a 0NE, but magically, precisely amid!  
Feel free to wander around, it  [~~live in a coal mine~~](./) looks dark.
